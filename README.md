## Problem Statement
The problem at hand was to gain relevant insights from a corpus of around 200k articles published
in the news between 1st January and 6th May about why business and people are moving out of
Illinois and Chicago and provide relevant recommendations to counter these trends.

## Modelling Approach
In an attempt to come up with good recommendations, the approach followed was to clean the text
of these articles as thoroughly as possible and pass the cleaned text through sentiment Analyzers,
Named Entity recognisers and LDA to come up with the topics being discussed in these articles.

## Insights
The main reason for leaving Illinois, as can be found from these articles, has been the increase in
shooting violence in the state along with greater number of drug cases. Other reasons also
included teachers protesting for hybrid learning methods, extreme and harsh winter climate and
insider trading in companies.

The recommendations provided by the following report mainly focuses on stricter rules regarding
gun ownership, drug consumption and distribution and more state involvement in public
education and the financial markets. The analysis here can be improved, neverthless, it does some
interesting observations to be considered.
